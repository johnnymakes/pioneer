# Pioneer weekly update 20-10-2019


## Product / R&D

üìçSkillmap ‚Äì human skills discovery layer & scaling device:  

A lot of new product changes were implemented this week, based on user feedback:

* ‚úÖ Fully built 1-use 'golden ticket' referral system, tested & shipped. I'm attempting to strike a balance between scaling an invite-only network and just opening the doors to everyone. Whilst members have to pass an application, they can now also gift 1 other person immediate access ‚Äì a golden ticket. As each member ONLY has one golden ticket, the idea is that they only share with someone that they feel would be a good fit for the early stage community. Golden tickets mean that we can maintain scarcity & values whilst still scaling up > letting members pick future members!  

* ‚úÖ Written essay about Skillmap progress and design. Published on johnnymakes.co and Medium.  

* ‚úÖ Featured on BetaList which is driving some traffic to Skillmap. The conversation rate seems very healthy at present given a fairly simple landing page ‚Äì so apparently the messaging is at least connecting somewhat.  

* ‚úÖ Currently ~35 new applicants per day. Applicants are quite spread out geographically, so my challenge remains achieving local density rather than global sparseness.  

* ‚úÖ Met w/ owners of 5 coworking spaces. Good progress towards local growth mechanic.  

* ‚úÖ Lot of bug fixes. Several identified as users were failing to complete onboarding.

üëüReadyset ‚Äì competition-based multiplayer workspace w/ temporary team formation:  

*  ‚úÖ Experience prototype complete (a combination of manual & no-code: Telegram bot with Airtable). ‚è≥ Trial delayed ~5 days. Incentives in place, but needed to change date to fit attendees.

*  ‚úÖ Began running a test with experience prototype with the aim of determining the value and design considerations of a competition based social workspace  
  
*  ‚úÖ App dev continues ~ 30% built. Building out some of the flows, but also testing and refining the design with real users

Ongoing:

*  ‚è≥ Conducting research into remote social bond formation, Dunbar groups etc.  

*  ‚è≥ Building knowledge of game design mechanics  

*  ‚è≥ Open dialogue with experts in game design mechanics  
  
  
  
## User testing  
  
  
*  ‚úÖ Next 5 of 20+ in-depth user interviews. I'm trying to not fall into a purely execution trap, so taking a little time to go deeper on the aspects of the problem and make sure I'm tackling the problem the right way. Early indications seem great, but with useful data around about the user's needs can be best fulfilled and how to position to product in a way that resonates strongest. 

*  ‚è≥ Captured a lot of Hotjar data, so will conduct analysis this week to find room for improvements on Skillmap.

## Go To Market

* With 2 active cities on Skillmap (PW's social layer), I'm switching the strategy back to primarily on local density. I want to make sure I'm truly adding value before onboarding more users. The current set get the product, but more can be done to achieve higher usage.    

* Written value exchange plan for coworking spaces. Will make sales landing page in upcoming week.

* Working with 1 coworking space and a startup campus in Budapest to onboard their members. Taking a little time, but I've also made improvements to better meet their requirements.
