# Pioneer weekly update 29-09-2019


## User testing  
  
  
1. ‚úÖ First 5 of 20+ in-depth user interviews. I'm trying to not fall into a purely execution trap, so taking a little time to go deeper on the aspects of the problem and make sure I'm tackling the problem the right way. Early indications seem great, but with useful data around about the user's needs can be best fulfilled and how to position to product in a way that resonates strongest. For example, a learning this week was that Skillmap needs to go deeper on fulfilling social needs and that I'm missing a lot of opportunities in the current design ‚Äì e.g. digital nomads want to meet others with similar interests, the map UI could be more clear, needs data filtering etc.  

2. ‚úÖ 6 UX and general usability user tests

## Go To Market

* With 2 active cities on Skillmap (PW's social layer), I'm switching the strategy back to primarily on local density. I want to make sure I'm truly adding value before onboarding more users. The current set get the product, but more can be done to achieve higher usage.    

* Working with 1 coworking space and a startup campus in Budapest to onboard their members.
 
* Producing laptop stickers as a kind of visual social proof and to increase user bond with early product ‚Äì switching to a different supplier.
