----

üìçSkillmap ‚Äì human skills discovery layer & scaling device:  

*  ‚úÖ Beginning to mass onboard 140 beta signups

*  ‚úÖ a lot of hygiene work: a good deal of the weak was spent making Skillmap more performant, slicker, and a lot of code refactoring  

*  ‚úÖ Built automated-email notifications (to re-engage users). Part of Skillmap's design is allowing the user to be passive and for us to do the informational heavy lifting and to provide value whilst they sleep. Email notifications bring them back on when the service has value to offer.  

*  ‚úÖ Refined onboarding flow to gently guide users to create 'useful' profiles rather than half-populating.

*  ‚è≥ Conducting research into remote social bond formation, Dunbar groups etc.

*  ‚è≥ Building knowledge of game design mechanics

*  ‚è≥ Beginning to open dialogue with experts in game design mechanics
