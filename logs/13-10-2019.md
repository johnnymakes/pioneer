# Pioneer weekly update 13-10-2019


## Product / R&D

üëüReadyset ‚Äì competition-based multiplayer workspace w/ temporary team formation:  

*  ‚úÖ Experience prototype complete (a combination of manual & no-code: Telegram bot with Airtable)

*  ‚úÖ Began running a test with experience prototype with the aim of determining the value and design consideratons of a competition based social workspace  
  
*  ‚úÖ App dev continues ‚Äì building out some of the flows, but also testing and refining the design with real users
  
----

üìçSkillmap ‚Äì human skills discovery layer & scaling device:  

*  ‚úÖ New learnings from user interviews & testing ‚Äì a lot of new product changes coming

*  ‚úÖ Major rebuild of onboarding flow to gently guide users to create 'useful' profiles rather than half-populating.  

*  ‚úÖ More hygiene work: making Skillmap more performant, slicker, and code refactoring.  

*  ‚úÖ Continued strong onboarding and growth. Will put on pause to work on P/M fit 

*  ‚è≥ Conducting research into remote social bond formation, Dunbar groups etc.  

*  ‚è≥ Building knowledge of game design mechanics  

*  ‚è≥ Beginning to open dialogue with experts in game design mechanics  
  
  
  
## User testing  
  
  
1. ‚úÖ Next 5 of 20+ in-depth user interviews. I'm trying to not fall into a purely execution trap, so taking a little time to go deeper on the aspects of the problem and make sure I'm tackling the problem the right way. Early indications seem great, but with useful data around about the user's needs can be best fulfilled and how to position to product in a way that resonates strongest. For example, a learning this week was that Skillmap needs to go deeper on fulfilling social needs and that I'm missing a lot of opportunities in the current design ‚Äì e.g. digital nomads want to meet others with similar interests, the map UI could be more clear, needs data filtering etc.  

2. ‚úÖ 7 UX and general usability tests with my target user group   




## Engineering / Operations

Actions done ‚úÖ:

* engineering spike into integrating Nexedus into Skillmap ‚Äì providing APIs into when many coworking spaces would have their members present. Likely the main challenge will be in matching users in different systems if they don't use the same email.
* designed a new icon for sales and update everywhere #skillmap 
* re-styled refinement list and fixed a bug that broke popups! #skillmap 
* working refinement list on map. Users can now filter for a specific skill #skillmap 
* design tweaks to chatpanel #skillmap 
* added newly computed dates to each chat, now splits between today time and date every past day #skillmap 
* totally rebuilt conversation ordering in the chatpanel, so it now sorts and builds the list from JSON #skillmap 
* new spooky ghost mode #skillmap 
* added new generated emoji based on category (to add more variance to results of users that don't spend further time on their profile) #skillmap 
* added coworking space detail sections on each map-initiated popup #skillmap 
* generally improved map formatting #skillmap 
* fixed csrf bug #skillmap 
* not perfect but added an emoji keyboard to profile emoji field #skillmap 
* updated previously generic 1-liners to match new convention #skillmap 
* made one-liner less generic through customising for each primary_skill #skillmap 
* split local and prod environment variable management tools (boring but had to do) #skillmap 
* first pass at a #pw home screen 
* weekly pioneer submit & vote #pw 
* cleared stage 2 FotF fellowship 


## Go To Market

* With 2 active cities on Skillmap (PW's social layer), I'm switching the strategy back to primarily on local density. I want to make sure I'm truly adding value before onboarding more users. The current set get the product, but more can be done to achieve higher usage.    

* Working with 1 coworking space and a startup campus in Budapest to onboard their members. Taking a little time, but I've also made improvements to better meet their requirements.

  


## Funding / advisors  

* ‚úÖ Waiting on further steps with Techstars, YC 

* ‚úÖ Looking at potentially applying to Facebook's accelerator and I've been invited to apply to another prominent accelerator programme
