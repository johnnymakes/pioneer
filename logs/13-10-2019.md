# Pioneer weekly update 13-10-2019


## Product / R&D

üìçSkillmap ‚Äì human skills discovery layer & scaling device:  

A lot of new product changes were implemented this week, based on user feedback:

*  ‚úÖ Live data filters on map ‚Äì so a user can more quickly parse the people in a city via their skills.  

*  ‚úÖ Interests ‚Äì more personal data, because users were also very keen to simply meet people who they might connect with socially, so this allows their to be a more human element to the app, so it isn't purely business.  

*  ‚úÖ Coworking space info ‚Äì changed the format to better illustrate aspects of a workspace that a user cares about.  
  
*  ‚úÖ More performant in-app chat ‚Äì conversations now render faster, in chronological order based on last interaction date and independently flag if the active user hasn't seen the most recent messages (user consumption horizon).  
  
*  ‚úÖ Emoji keyboard ‚Äì simply to make the it easier for a user to populate the profile emoji image.  
  
  
And some changes based on data:  
  
*  ‚úÖ Generating different one-liners and emoji for each 'primary skill' role ‚Äì because some users weren't taking the time upfront to customise their profiles, it meant that a proportion of them had placeholder data, which not only detracts value from a user trying to discover other people, but it also quickly gets repetitive. Instead, the placeholder data is now varied by the 'primary skill' attribute, so they each feel a little more different and provide more value to an exploring user.


*  ‚úÖ Building profile population more deeply into the onboarding journey ‚Äì I was seeing mixed completion rates for profile pages, which means that some users don't get to the stage where they are adding or receiving value from the network. For this reason, key profile sections are built into onboarding, ensuring completion... and if it causes drop out, then the user wouldn't have contributed in any case.  


*  ‚è≥ Began work on the referral model that will grow the base of the network whilst maintaining an overall bar of quality. I'll be implementing a member-get-member scheme, which will ship without links to incentives, but in the very near future I'll link it to the gamification elements so that users will be more compelled to engage.

*  ‚úÖ New partner sales flow ‚Äì Built a sales flow so that interested spaces can apply to join the network. As with the consumer side, scarcity dynamics are at play and only a limited number of spaces will be accepted. Later on, this can be linked to a payment model, generating a logical and simple income stream ‚Äì one of the cleanest ways to generate income is by enabling others to do so. However, in the first instance the focus will be on simply achieving distribution.

üëüReadyset ‚Äì competition-based multiplayer workspace w/ temporary team formation:  

*  ‚úÖ Experience prototype complete (a combination of manual & no-code: Telegram bot with Airtable)

*  ‚úÖ Began running a test with experience prototype with the aim of determining the value and design considerations of a competition based social workspace  
  
*  ‚úÖ App dev continues ‚Äì building out some of the flows, but also testing and refining the design with real users

Ongoing:

*  ‚è≥ Conducting research into remote social bond formation, Dunbar groups etc.  

*  ‚è≥ Building knowledge of game design mechanics  

*  ‚è≥ Open dialogue with experts in game design mechanics  
  
  
  
## User testing  
  
  
1. ‚úÖ Next 5 of 20+ in-depth user interviews. I'm trying to not fall into a purely execution trap, so taking a little time to go deeper on the aspects of the problem and make sure I'm tackling the problem the right way. Early indications seem great, but with useful data around about the user's needs can be best fulfilled and how to position to product in a way that resonates strongest. For example, a learning this week was that Skillmap needs to go deeper on fulfilling social needs and that I'm missing a lot of opportunities in the current design ‚Äì e.g. digital nomads want to meet others with similar interests, the map UI could be more clear, needs data filtering etc.  

2. ‚úÖ 7 UX and general usability tests with my target user group   




## Engineering / Operations

Actions done ‚úÖ:

* engineering spike into integrating Nexedus into Skillmap ‚Äì providing APIs into when many coworking spaces would have their members present. Likely the main challenge will be in matching users in different systems if they don't use the same email.
* designed a new icon for sales and update everywhere #skillmap 
* re-styled refinement list and fixed a bug that broke popups! #skillmap 
* working refinement list on map. Users can now filter for a specific skill #skillmap 
* design tweaks to chatpanel #skillmap 
* added newly computed dates to each chat, now splits between today time and date every past day #skillmap 
* totally rebuilt conversation ordering in the chatpanel, so it now sorts and builds the list from JSON #skillmap 
* new spooky ghost mode #skillmap 
* added new generated emoji based on category (to add more variance to results of users that don't spend further time on their profile) #skillmap 
* added coworking space detail sections on each map-initiated popup #skillmap 
* generally improved map formatting #skillmap 
* fixed csrf bug #skillmap 
* not perfect but added an emoji keyboard to profile emoji field #skillmap 
* updated previously generic 1-liners to match new convention #skillmap 
* made one-liner less generic through customising for each primary_skill #skillmap 
* split local and prod environment variable management tools (boring but had to do) #skillmap 
* first pass at a #pw home screen 
* weekly pioneer submit & vote #pw 
* cleared stage 2 FotF fellowship 


## Go To Market

* With 2 active cities on Skillmap (PW's social layer), I'm switching the strategy back to primarily on local density. I want to make sure I'm truly adding value before onboarding more users. The current set get the product, but more can be done to achieve higher usage.    

* Working with 1 coworking space and a startup campus in Budapest to onboard their members. Taking a little time, but I've also made improvements to better meet their requirements.

  


## Funding / advisors  

* ‚úÖ Waiting on further steps with Techstars, YC 

* ‚úÖ Looking at potentially applying to Facebook's accelerator and I've been invited to apply to another prominent accelerator programme
