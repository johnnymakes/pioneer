# Pioneer weekly update 19-08-2019

## Product / R&D

1. ⏳ Conducting research into remote social bond formation, Dunbar groups etc.
2. 🧪 Switching core metric to maximise feedback and evaluate product/market fit w/ Superhuman's cohort methodology
3. ⏳ Building knowledge in game design mechanics
4. ⏳ Beginning to open dialogue with experts in game design mechanics


## Funding / advisors

1. ⏳ Meeting w/ Harry Stebbings @ Stride.VC postponed
2. ✅ Applied to 1 accelerator
3. ✅ YC Startup School group session, got some good inputs around go-to-market
4. ✅ Follow-up chats with a number of other Pioneer players


## User testing

1. ✅ 6 UX and general usability user tests
2. ✅ Refactoring work on UI  

  
## Engineering

1. ✅ Built fully functional real-time in-app messaging to 100%!  
(Complex to implement, but worth the time because it makes a much better user experience rather than merely connecting users and expecting them to share a more intimate/permanent real-world comms channel e.g. phone number. Means less time between connecting, opening a dialogue and actually meeting/collaborating, esp. versus a high-friction alterative like email.)
