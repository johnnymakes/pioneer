üëüReadyset ‚Äì competition-based multiplayer workspace w/ temporary team formation:  

*  ‚úÖ Experiment round 1 complete (a combination of manual & no-code: Telegram bot with Airtable). 

*  ‚è≥ Need to write up experiment learnings and prep for round 2. 
  
*  ‚úÖ Changed app build approach to simplify ‚Äì will be complete next week. Building out some of the flows, but also testing and refining the design with real users

Ongoing:

*  ‚è≥ Conducting research into remote social bond formation, Dunbar groups etc.  

*  ‚è≥ Building knowledge of game design mechanics  

*  ‚è≥ Open dialogue with experts in game design mechanics  
  
  
  
## User testing  
  
  
*  ‚úÖ Next 5 of 20+ in-depth user interviews. I'm trying to not fall into a purely execution trap, so taking a little time to go deeper on the aspects of the problem and make sure I'm tackling the problem the right way. Early indications seem great, but with useful data around about the user's needs can be best fulfilled and how to position to product in a way that resonates strongest. 

*  ‚è≥ Captured a lot of Hotjar data, so will conduct analysis this week to find room for improvements on Skillmap.

## Go To Market

* With 2 active cities on Skillmap (PW's social layer), I'm switching the strategy back to primarily on local density. I want to make sure I'm truly adding value before onboarding more users. The current set get the product, but more can be done to achieve higher usage.    

* Written value exchange plan for coworking spaces. Will make sales landing page in upcoming week.

* Working with 1 coworking space and a startup campus in Budapest to onboard their members. Taking a little time, but I've also made improvements to better meet their requirements.
