# Pioneer weekly update 26-08-2019

## Engineering

1. ‚úÖ MVP is basically done! All the pieces are there ‚Äì I'm showing it to go-to-market partners this week so hope to start picking up some users in a few dense pockets (need achieve a minimum density in order for the app to feel populated and to provide value). It's not entirely beautiful, but it works. These user's will be tested against Superhuman's product/market fit framework.  

Will include an app walkthrough in next week's update.  

2. ‚úÖ Finished building the map aspect of the app, along with linking up the core application backend to sync with the map datasets and push to a single styled tileset.

3. ‚úÖ More than planned: I build both users and also coworking spaces into the mapping layer. ‚Äì I'm deeply integrating this growth hack so that it provides mutual value: coworking spaces increase their own discoverability, value and sales, and in return provide a launch channel and source of data back to us.  

4. ‚úÖ Overcame a lot of technical bugs and some learning curve (this MVP effectively combines a geographic search engine with a chat app)¬†‚Äì but latest version is fully working in production.  

5. ‚è≥ Chrome extension (for passive usage and location polling) still should be done for ASAP for a better user experience.  

  
## Go To Market

1. ‚úÖ Have interest and open conversation with 6 coworking brand partners in a variety of global locations  


## Product / R&D

1. ‚è≥ Conducting research into remote social bond formation, Dunbar groups etc.
2. üß™ Switching core metric to maximise feedback and evaluate product/market fit w/ Superhuman's cohort methodology
3. ‚è≥ Building knowledge of game design mechanics
4. ‚è≥ Beginning to open dialogue with experts in game design mechanics


## Funding / advisors

1. ‚úÖ In process with 2 accelerator programmes
2. ‚úÖ Had YC Startup School group session, got some good inputs around maximising value
3. ‚úÖ Follow-up chats with a number of other Pioneer players


## User testing

1. ‚úÖ 11 UX and general usability user tests ‚Äì simplified designs for linking out to coworking spaces


## Misc

1. I moved countries! üß≥ Still solo on this project, so there was some bandwidth impact from the move and getting set up.
