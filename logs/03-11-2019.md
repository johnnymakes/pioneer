# Pioneer weekly update 3-11-2019


## Product / R&D

üìçSkillmap ‚Äì human skills discovery layer & scaling device:  

* ‚úÖ Ran Budapest city launch event to try to generate local density and awareness. The event proved a great success, gaining an extra 40 users from the entire event and a lot of feedback, both on the product and the proposition.

üëüReadyset ‚Äì competition-based multiplayer workspace w/ team formation:  

*  ‚úÖ Experiment round 1 complete (a combination of manual & no-code: Telegram bot with Airtable). WRITE UP HERE: [LINK](https://johnnymakes.github.io/pioneer-updates/logs/rs-cycle-1.html)

  
* ‚úÖ Pivoting engineering approach, collab w/ tech lead that built award-winning remote team video app
  
  
----  
  
  
Ongoing:

*  ‚è≥ Conducting research into remote social bond formation, Dunbar groups etc.  

*  ‚è≥ Building knowledge of game design mechanics  

*  ‚è≥ Open dialogue with experts in game design mechanics  
  
  
  
## User testing  
  
  
*  ‚úÖ Next 5 of 20+ in-depth user interviews. I'm trying to not fall into a purely execution trap, so taking a little time to go deeper on the aspects of the problem and make sure I'm tackling the problem the right way. Early indications seem great, but with useful data around about the user's needs can be best fulfilled and how to position to product in a way that resonates strongest. 

*  ‚è≥ Captured a lot of Hotjar data, so will conduct analysis this week to find room for improvements on Skillmap.



## Engineering / Operations

Actions done ‚úÖ:

* dev work on RS prototype
* updated #readyset IH page and waiting for approval 
* rewritten #readyset landing for experiment run 
* had budapest launch event (and gained about 40 new users in the process!) for #skillmap 
* onboarded 5 more users in budapest #skillmap 
* fixed safari mobile UI onboarding bug #skillmap 
* v1 #skillmap presentation deck for event 
* arranged and promoted #skillmap mini launch party

## Go To Market

* With 2 active cities on Skillmap (PW's social layer), I'm switching the strategy back to primarily on local density. I want to make sure I'm truly adding value before onboarding more users. The current set get the product, but more can be done to achieve higher usage.    

* Written value exchange plan for coworking spaces, will continue to implement with new spaces.

* Working with 1 coworking space and a startup campus in Budapest to onboard their members. Taking a little time, but I've also made improvements to better meet their requirements.

  


## Funding / advisors  

* ‚úÖ Waiting on further steps with Techstars 

* ‚úÖ Accepted into FotF Fellowship
