# ðŸ‘ŸReadyset â€“ experiment cycle #1

  
## Method

* Tested a 1st run with primarily friends and contacts, 8 players in total, getting 4  onto each side of the team game. 
  
* Players manually submitted their tasks via Airtable, whereupon other players could vote on the anonymised tasks and whether they agreed with the tasks difficulty sizing or not.  

* During the work session, players work on their projects and discuss amongst their team mates. The two teams are kept separate. 

* At the end of the session, players submit work completed, which gets anonymised and voted upon by players.

* Winning team is the one with the most validated proof of work.
  
  

## Results

* Starting the session was challenging, the lobby needs to work better at collecting and keeping users engaged.  

* Micro-interactions between teams could be a nice way to stoke competition â€“ gives teams better visibility of each other.  

* Users were well connected, but if they weren't, there wasn't much space given to establishing connections and bonds

* "Fighting talk" â€“ how can we spice up the competition
  

## Learnings

* Better if users don't have to hop between platforms

* It would be a more accurate study if participants didn't know each other â€“ bonds are already formed in this case.
  
* Intro / ice-breakers may be a good solution for the next round, warming players up to one another

* Real prizes / incentives will help drive more focus competition.
