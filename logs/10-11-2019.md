## Go To Market

* With 2 active cities on Skillmap (PW's social layer), I'm switching the strategy back to primarily on local density. I want to make sure I'm truly adding value before onboarding more users. The current set get the product, but more can be done to achieve higher usage.    

* Written value exchange plan for coworking spaces, will continue to implement with new spaces.

* Working with 1 coworking space and a startup campus in Budapest to onboard their members. Taking a little time, but I've also made improvements to better meet their requirements.

  


## Funding / advisors  

* ✅ Waiting on further steps with Techstars
